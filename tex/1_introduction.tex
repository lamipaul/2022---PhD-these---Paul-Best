\section{Cetaceans and acoustics}

Despite a first appearance on land, some mammalian species are now commonly found in planet Earth's oceans, forming the marine mammals group. Families evolving from 3 distinct orders have physiologically evolved to thrive in the marine environment: Pinnipeds (\textit{Carnivora}, e.g. seals and walruses), Sirenians (\textit{Afrotheria}, e.g. manatees), and Cetaceans (\textit{Cetartiodactyla}, e.g. whales and dolphins). The following thesis will focus on the latter. Cetaceans are classified into two suborders: Odontocetes (toothed cetaceans, such as dolphins, orcas or sperm whales) and Mysticetes (baleen cetaceans, such as blue whales or humpback whales, see Fig.~\ref{fig:evolution}).

\end{figure}

Returning to the sea some 50 million years ago \cite{whitehead2015cultural}, cetaceans now show a complete adaptation to their marine environment, with their powerful flukes, streamlined body, and nostrils displaced on top of their head (allowing for efficient breathing while swimming). Another important adaptation, especially relevant to this study, is the development of their acoustic capabilities, both as emitters and as receivers. Indeed, light typically fades out after a few dozen meters in water, which makes of vision a quite limited sense. In contrast, the higher density of water (compared to air) makes sound travel faster and further. Cetaceans make use of this property to communicate and/or echolocate up to great distances. Blue whale calls can be heard 200km away \cite{vsirovic2007blue}, and sperm whales are able to detect a 1m object at 470m \cite{ferrari2020study}.


\subsection{Echolocation}

One of the uses cetaceans make of underwater acoustics is echolocation. Alike an active sonar, emitting a sound and measuring how it bounces back to you (its echo) allows to sense distance from surrounding objects, their shape \cite{pack1996dolphins}, or even their texture \cite{grunwald2004classification} (Fig.~\ref{fig:echolocation}). Bats use echolocation to navigate and hunt in dark caves, odontocetes use echolocation in a similar way underwater. 

Short impulse like sounds commonly named `clicks' (transitory waves) are mostly associated with echolocation purposes \cite{au2000echolocation}. However, there is not one single type of click used for echolocation: it might coincide with habitats and feeding behaviours \cite{ketten1994functional}. Using short duration clicks, more can be sent in a small period of time without them mixing up, thus increasing the potential temporal resolution of the echolocation. This is typically suited for hunting at high speeds, like small odontocetes do. On the other hand, clicks at lower frequencies will travel further, and thus would be more suited for hunting from long distances like sperm whales do (extremely high Kogia clicks go against this hypothesis).

Finally, despite the old consensus that only odontocetes echolocate with their high frequency clicks, new studies suggest that mysticetes might also make use of their low frequency signals as sonars \cite{iii2018sonar}.

    \label{fig:echolocation}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Communication}

The second major use of sound by cetaceans is communication, a broad concept that can be divided into two main categories: song and social communication systems \cite{janik2014cetacean}.


\subsubsection{Song}

The term song has been first used for cetacean signals by \citet{payne1971songs}, listening to humpback whales whose vocalisations met the following definition: "a series of notes, generally of more than one type, uttered in succession and so related as to form a recognisable sequence or pattern in time”. Similarly to bird songs, they have shown a role in reproductive behaviours: mostly males are observed singing, during the reproductive season, potentially to attract females, fend off other males, or a combination of both \cite{darling2001interactions, smith2008songs}. Songs usually come in strictly patterned sequences, shared by whole species or communities \cite{whitehead2015cultural}. Among cetaceans, they have yet been observed only in mysticetes, with the most renowned one probably being the humpback whale song.


\subsubsection{Social communication}

On the other hand, communication is also observed in odontocetes social groups. Alike in songs, these signals are patterned vocalisations, some of which being identified in discrete categories \cite{ford1987catalogue, weilgart1993coda}. However, they are not restricted to reproductive contexts, and appear in relatively less deterministic sequences. The term song therefore seems less appropriate for this phenomenon, which is rather associated with social bonding functions \cite{schulz2008overlapping, ford1989acoustic}.
% vocal learning ? dolphins learning sentences\cite{herman1984comprehension}.

In most cases, these vocal signals occur with tonal, whistled or pulsed calls. Their associated categories (`call type') are commonly defined by characteristics on their time / frequency contour. As an exception, sperm whales produce clicks in stereotyped rhythmic sequences (named codas) that were also attributed to communication purposes \cite{weilgart1993coda}. It is however not excluded that other odontocetes use clicks as means of communication, but no similar stereotyped sequences have yet been observed among them.


\subsection{Culture}

The term culture is often encountered when describing cetacean communication systems \cite{filatova2015cultural, garland2020cultural, rendell2003vocal}. It seems appropriate to describe the vocal divergences observed between cetacean communities. In a broad sense, culture is defined as `behaviour or information shared within a community, that is acquired from conspecifics through some form of social learning' \cite{whitehead2015cultural}. %Culture is especially relevant as a community marker, helping to identify close relatives within the species \cite{todo}.
In cetaceans, it takes form as specialisation in diets or hunting techniques (e.g. with orcas) or as specific vocal patterns. For instance, sperm whale codas \cite{rendell2003vocal} (Fig.~\ref{fig:codas}), orca stereotyped calls \cite{deecke2000dialect}, humpback whale songs \cite{garland2011dynamic} (Fig.~\ref{fig:HB_culture}) or fin whale pulse sequences \cite{castellote2012fin}, are all community specific, some evolving through the years, and thus are described as cultural phenomenons. This is only possible thanks to the vocal production learning capacity that cetaceans demonstrate \cite{janik2014cetacean}, a relatively rare characteristic among mammals.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Human activity impacts}

In the twentieth century, close to 3 million large whales were caught by whalers \cite{rocha2014emptying}. Seeing some whale species coming close to extinction has motivated a large majority of the international community to cease commercial whaling in the late 20th century. However, cetaceans are still heavily impacted by human marine activities in numerous ways (Fig.~\ref{fig:human_impact}). We will focus here on the ones related to acoustics.

There exist a wide variety of anthropogenic acoustic disturbances in the marine environment, which has triggered the development of a new fields of research focusing solely on ambient noise levels \cite{merchant2012averaging}. Marine traffic, seismic surveys using airguns (often to search for oil patches), pile driving (for marine constructions such as offshore wind turbines), military sonars and explosive tests are the most widespread, with several consequences on cetaceans.

We hear better in a silent environment. This implies the first consequence of acoustic disturbances: acoustic masking. With increasing ambient noise levels, the hearing capacities of cetaceans decrease, thus hindering their ability to communicate, hunt, and navigate \cite{erbe2016communication}. More generally, dense marine traffic has also been shown to cause stress to some cetaceans species \cite{rolland2012evidence}. 

The second main consequence is acoustic impairment: temporary or permanent injuries of the hearing apparatus. Powerful sounds such as those emitted by airguns or military tests have been shown to cause deafness in some cetaceans, sometimes leading to mass strandings \cite{parsons2017impacts}.

Eventually, arising from a dense marine traffic, presumably combined with disorientation due to acoustic masking, the collision problem has also attracted the attention of the cetacean conservation community. Especially affecting large mysticetes (e.g. fin whales or right whales), records of death from collisions with boats show a significant impact on whale populations \cite{rockwood2017high}, motivating measures to mitigate collision risks.

\end{figure}


\section{Passive Acoustic Monitoring of cetaceans}

To reveal the aforementioned complexity and diversity of cetacean's uses of acoustics, scientists also have put forward their hearing sense. \ac{PAM} is a field of bioacoustic studies that combines several scientific and technical domains, from electronics for recording hardware, to signal processing and statistical analysis. The term passive refers to the notion of listening from a distance, without interfering with the animals, as opposed to active sonar systems or attaching acoustic tags to the animals. The analysis of the cetaceans acoustic activity is providing important insights on their behaviour, population dynamics, social structures or even physiology.


\subsection{Comparison of acoustic and visual surveys}

Besides PAM, visual surveys is the second main approach to the biological study of cetaceans. Each comes with its pros and cons. The acoustic approach enables long term surveys at relatively low costs: placing a fixed antenna allows to monitor biological activities for several consecutive months, requiring human intervention only for the installation and extraction of the recording system. In contrast, the visual approach demands a continuous human implication throughout the survey, in the relatively inaccessible marine environment.

In terms of detection capacities, cetaceans can be heard from great distances (up to 200km for the blue whale \cite{vsirovic2007blue}), even during deep dives, while they can be visually detected from relatively short distances (around 1km, depending on weather conditions) only when surfacing (less than a third of the time for sperm whales \cite{watwood2006deep}). However, species had first to be classified visually before we could learn on their associated acoustic behaviour, and photo identification is still to this day the only reliable way to recognise individuals. Moreover, the observation of group sizes, behaviour, and body conditions still mostly relies on vision. The two approaches thus really are complementary.


\subsection{Antenna types}

\ac{PAM} starts by placing hydrophone(s) (underwater microphones) to listen or record the acoustic environment. They can be fixed on the sea floor (bottom mounted), to a buoy (sonobuoy), to a cable towed by a boat (towed array), or directly to the hull of a boat or \ac{ASV} (Fig.~\ref{fig:sphyrna}). When recording with multiple synchronised hydrophones, one can also triangulate (infer the position of) sound sources, by measuring their \acp{TDOA} for instance. The types of recording devices, their placement in the water column, and their layout between each other have crucial impacts on the yielded recordings, facilitating or not the following signal processing analysis.

For that matter, when implementing acoustic recording systems, one has to make compromises. Indeed, the functioning time of a recorder is limited by its available resources (battery power and data storage). On the other hand, settings that allow for a more detailed view of the acoustic scene (increased number of channels, sampling frequency and/or the byte depth) also imply a higher rate of consumption of these resources.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{fig/sphyrna.png}
    \caption{Example of a multi-hydrophone antenna mounted on an \ac{ASV}, taken from \citet{poupard2019real}.}
    \label{fig:sphyrna}
\end{figure}


\subsection{PAM for biological studies}

Once recordings have been collected, the first step of their analysis typically comes down to the detection and classification of cetacean vocalisations. The amount of detection through time in long term surveys already provides significant information on the animals' lives. From these, one can infer population density \cite{thomas2012passive} and seasonal or dial presence patterns \cite{bombyx}. When combining several antennas, a spatial dimension can be also integrated.

The analysis of the detected signals can then bring further knowledge on the recorded animals, such as community membership, current behaviour (hunting, socialising, courting), and individual's characteristics (e.g. sexual maturity or body size for sperm whales \cite{bombyx}). These measures can themselves be put in a space-time perspective, potentially revealing patterns. In this way, \ac{PAM} becomes useful to cetacean ethology and stock structure assessment.

A second field \ac{PAM} provides to is the study of animal communication systems. Indeed, cetaceans represent a significant part among the vocal learning species (along with birds, bats, seals, elephants, mice and primates). Identifying patterned sequences and associating them with species, communities and/or behaviours yields exemplary data on the development of vocal interaction in the animal kingdom \cite{fitch2006biology}. Moreover, acoustic behaviour studies revealing cultural differences has provided knowledge on population dynamics \cite{owen2019migratory} (Fig.~\ref{fig:HB_culture}) and social structures \cite{gero2016individual}. There is therefore a great diversity of biological wonders that \ac{PAM} contributes to unveil.
%Again, \ac{PAM} has provided exemplary data on phenomenons such as cultural evolution and transmission, helping advance on these open research questions.

    \label{fig:HB_culture}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Cetacean conservation}

Some may question the amount of effort put into cetacean biology studies, considering that knowledge of nature is not in itself a sufficient driver. In that regard, it is to be kept in mind that cetaceans are at the top of the ocean's food web, consequently being significant regulators of their ecosystem as a whole. Moreover, the oceanic ecosystem is not only an important provider of food to humans, but also crucial to breathe (it is responsible for around 70\% of the atmosphere's oxygen production \cite{harris2012phytoplankton}). This field of study thus matters not only for the knowledge of planet earth's animal kingdom, but simply to our long term survival.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{fig/speed_canada.png}
    \caption{Example of conservation measure in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada \cite{speed_canada}. Reduced speed zones are put in place all year round (red) and seasonally (green) to protect North Atlantic Right Whales.}\label{fig:speed_canada}
\end{figure}

As stated previously, human activities heavily impact cetacean species, putting some of them close to extinction \cite{kraus2016recent}. Considering their aforementioned importance, it seems relevant that we learn how to mitigate this impact and work on cetacean conservation policies. Some regulation measures have already been put in place like the Marine Mammal Protection Act \cite{fisheries2013marine}, speed regulations \cite{fisheries2012environmental} (Fig.~\ref{fig:speed_canada}), and the definition of marine mammal sanctuaries \cite{notarbartolo2008pelagos, tetley2022important}. Monitoring the efficiency and necessity of regulations, as well as maximising their relevance (e.g. habitats and/or seasons of importance) can only be done via the knowledge of the animals, which justifies their study.


\section{Neural Networks and PAM}

\subsection{Automated PAM before Neural Networks}

As previously stated, acoustic detections are needed to carry out long term cetacean surveys. They can be gathered by manually inspecting signals, especially their time-frequency representation (spectrograms). However, this is very costly in human efforts and non-repeatable, which motivated the development of automatic detection mechanisms. With such systems at hand, researchers can seamlessly process months of data to yield results such as spatio-temporal presence statistics.

Detection mechanisms have long been implemented with handcrafted algorithms \cite{gillespie2008pamguard}. They can be sufficient for some use cases, but often come quite limited, as the variety of sounds to detect and potential noises increase. Analysing long streams of data across recording devices and antenna locations demands highly robust systems, for which handcrafted algorithms remain unsatisfactory.

As an analogy, let us consider our ability to recognise our kin by the sound of their voice. Formally describing how to robustly differentiate talking individuals seems nearly impossible, especially in a computer language. However, we know that given a hearing sense and sufficient cognitive capacities, by listening to a voice several times, we acquire the capacity to recognise it. This led the scientific community to start shifting towards machine learning algorithms, which are introduced in the following section.


\subsection{Artificial neural networks}

Training \acp{ANN} is the chosen approach for the automation of \ac{PAM} throughout this thesis. It is one of the most popular techniques of machine learning, a field of computer sciences that approaches problem solving without programming solutions explicitly. Specifically, in machine learning, the algorithm is designed to find (or learn) a solution to a problem, often formulated as a mathematical framework. An analogy could be made that genes encode a brain structure for it to learn but genes do not encode knowledge directly. Similarly, in machine learning, a learning framework is programmed but the task's solution is to be learnt.

\acp{ANN} represent a major branch of today's machine learning, solving tasks in computer vision and speech recognition with performances and robustness highly superior to that of traditional handcrafted algorithms. This motivated the application of \acp{ANN} to the field of \ac{PAM}, making it the central topic of this thesis as described in the following section.


\section{Thesis objectives}

This thesis was co-financed by the GIAS European project, aiming at improving navigation security in the Mediterranean sea (western bassin). It takes part in one axis of this project: the mitigation of whale-ship collision risk. For that purpose, a `smart bioacoustic buoy' was designed, with the intent to acoustically detect large cetaceans of the zone (sperm whales and fin whales). Then, alerts can be transmitted close to real-time, for ships to adapt their speed or route accordingly.

Being a thesis in computer science, its goal is to design and implement the acoustic detection algorithms embedded in the buoy (collaborating with third parties on the hardware development). To this end, motivated by the recent advances in the field, the \ac{ANN} approach was chosen.

The work of training \acp{ANN} for the detection of cetacean vocalisations quickly expanded well beyond the initial needs of the GIAS project. Indeed, the team participates in a variety of projects (see section \ref{chap:data_Toulon}). In each of them, our role is typically to analyse large amounts of recordings to advance on biological questions. Hence the need for cetacean acoustic detection and classification mechanisms. Moreover, the performance demonstrated by \acp{ANN} in early experiments motivated to use them extensively on other species. This is how the objective of this work dissociated from the GIAS implementation to become a general study of applying \acp{ANN} to cetacean acoustic detection and classification.


\subsection{Structure of the manuscript}

\end{figure}

This document is organised as follows. First, chapter \ref{chap:sota} introduces the \ac{SOTA} of the deep learning techniques that will be used in this study, along with their precedent use for automated \ac{PAM}. Then, chapter \ref{chap:material} will go through the species of interest for this work, the signals they emit, and the recordings available. The rest of the manuscript then revolves around the three main steps needed to address \ac{PAM} with \acp{ANN} (Fig.~\ref{fig:thesis_flowchart}). Chapter \ref{chap:annotation} starts with the construction of training databases, describing annotation procedures suited for a variety of constraints (depending on the recordings at hand and the target signals). Then, to train \acp{ANN} on these databases, chapter \ref{chap:training} describes architectures and frameworks to yield robust detection and classification mechanisms (this time depending on constraints of computational power and target signals). Finally, for some of the trained models, chapters \ref{chap:conservation} and \ref{chap:com} illustrate their applications around two main uses: species conservation (for Mediterranean fin whales and sperm whales) and communication modelling (for fin whales and orcas).
