\minitoc

In this chapter will be introduced the material used for the experiments conducted throughout this thesis. It takes form as underwater acoustic data, containing several types of signals, and recorded at different places and times. This chapter will thus revolve around two axis: the studied signals, and the recording setups. 


\section{Target species and signals}

The diverse set of target signals described here are those for which detection and classification systems were built. Their characteristics are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:recap_signals}, and each subsection then underpins the current knowledge about them, especially regarding their context of emission.

Note that for the signal types of Tab.~\ref{tab:recap_signals}, and throughout this thesis, stationary refers to ``signals locally stable in frequency'' (calls, whistles) as opposed to transitory signals (clicks).

\subsection{Fin whale (\textit{Balaenoptera Physalus}) 20Hz pulses}

As the second largest animal on earth, the fin whale produces very low-pitched vocalisations, barely noticeable to the human ear. So far, bioacousticians have documented 3 main types of signals emitted by fin whales: 100-30\,Hz down-sweeps, 30\,Hz rumbles, and 20\,Hz pulses. They supposedly serve group cohesion \cite{payne1971orientation, watkins1981activities}, food signaling \cite{Romagosa}, and mate attraction \cite{Watkins_Tyack_Moore_Bird_1987, croll2002only}.


\begin{figure}[!htb]
   \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}

\end{figure}

In this thesis, I will focus on the most common signal: the 20\,Hz pulse. It is often further classified into two sub categories, named A and B, or classic pulse and back-beat \cite{sciacca2015annual}. They highly resembles a Gabor wavelet: a sine wave enveloped by a Gaussian (see Fig.\ref{fig:20Hzpulse}), and can be emitted either as single pulses, or in patterned sequences, termed as songs \cite{simon2010singing}. The pulses and the sequences they take part in are highly stereotyped: pulses show very low variability both in frequency and duration, and when in sequences, the \ac{INI} remains highly stable.

Fin whale song characteristics, especially the \ac{INI}, are population specific \cite{delarue2009geographic, castellote2012fin}. They also are subject to seasonal cyclic variations \cite{Oleson, morano2012seasonal}, as well as long-term trends \cite{weirathmueller2017spatial, helble2020fin} (e.g. linear increase of the \ac{INI} through years).


\subsection{Sperm whale (\textit{Physeter Macrocephalus}) clicks}

Sperm whales produce echolocation clicks to navigate and locate preys during hunts. Their large head contains a series of oil sacks surrounded by sound-reflecting air sacs that allows for the amplification of the impulses \cite{norris1972theory}, making it the most powerful sonar in the animal kingdom \cite{mohl2003monopulsed} (the loudest recorded click was at 230\,dB re: 1$\mu$Pa rms).

%The reverberation mechanism yields several pulses within a click, and the interval between them is often used as a proxy to estimate the animal's size \cite{gordon1991evaluation}. This interval, typically of around half a millisecond, is usually termed \ac{IPI}, but not to be confused with fin whale's \ac{IPI}, which describes 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/cacha_clicks.pdf}
    \caption{Sequence of sperm whale echolocation clicks recorded by Bombyx in july 2018. \ac{STFT} parameters are: $fs=50kHz$, $NFFT=1,024$, $hopsize=896$, $padding=0\%$.}
    \label{fig:cacha_clicks}
\end{figure}

Echolocation clicks usually come in sequences (see Fig.\ref{fig:cacha_clicks}), with the \ac{ICI} ranging between 0.01 and 1\,sec, usually decreasing when approaching a prey \cite{fais2016sperm}. The clicks lie around relatively low frequencies compared to other smaller odontocetes (between 3\,kHz and 30\,kHz). % pas sur This could enable the echolocation of objects at further distances (lower frequencies are subject to a lower propagation loss).


\subsection{Orca (\textit{Orcinus Orca}) calls}\label{chap:mat_calltype}

Orcas produce three types of signals: clicks, pulsed calls, and whistles \cite{ford1989acoustic}. As for most dolphin species, clicks presumably serve echolocation, while the two other more stationary signals would rather be used for communication. Pulsed calls are highly harmonic, typically lying between 500\,Hz and 5\,kHz, and lasting up to 1.5 seconds (Fig.~\ref{fig:orca_call}). On the other hand, whistles show little or no harmonic structure, lay between 6\,kHz and 12\,kHz, and can last up to 12 seconds. In this thesis, I will focus on the pulsed calls, referring to them as calls or vocalisations.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/orca_call.pdf}
    \caption{Sequence of orca tonal calls recorded at OrcaLab in September 2016. \ac{STFT} parameters are $fs=22050Hz$, $NFFT=1024$, $hopsize=50$, $padding=0\%$. The N.. labels denote each call type, with a `?' showing an ambiguous one.}
    \label{fig:orca_call}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:orca_call}, some orca calls have stereotyped frequency contours that have been classified into discrete types. These were proven to be community specific (dialectic) \cite{ford1987catalogue}, and subject to cultural evolution \cite{deecke2000dialect, filatova2015cultural}. The identification of call types strongly contributed to the study of the orca's social structures, and its categorisation is widely accepted by the scientific community. Difficulties remain however, for some calls to be attributed to one class or another, especially for non experts. Indeed, despite calls being stereotyped, they still are prone to variability which might lead to overlap between classes' characteristics \cite{ford1989acoustic}.


\subsection{Humpback whale (\textit{Megaptera Novaeangliae}) calls}

The humpback whale song is among the most widely studied cetacean acoustic signals. These sequences are mostly emitted by males during the reproductive season, presumably playing a role in courtship \cite{herman2017multiple} (male-female and/or male-male interaction). They follow strict hierarchical structures: series of units form phrases that are arranged into themes, themselves combined in songs that can last several hours \cite{payne1971songs}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/HB_calls.pdf}
    \caption{Extract of a humpback whale song from the Carimam dataset. \ac{STFT} parameters are $fs=22050Hz$, $NFFT=4096$, $hopsize=48$, $padding=50\%$.}
    \label{fig:HB_song}
\end{figure}

Each component of the hierarchical structure of the humpback whale songs are stereotyped, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:HB_song} with a sequence of stereotyped units. Moreover, song structures are shared by individuals at a given place and time, with cultural implications for their spatio-temporal evolution \cite{whitehead2015cultural}.


\subsection{Dolphin (\textit{Delphinidae}) whistles}

Exceptionally for this type of signal, we do not target a single species, but rather a family of species, the \textit{Delphinidae} which includes sub-families such as \textit{Globicephalinae}, \textit{Delphininae}, and \textit{Orcininae}. They all produce whistles, which are typically high pitched, tonal, and narrow-band. Their frequency contour can be stereotyped \cite{vester2017vocal}, individual specific \cite{caldwell1965individualized}, and serve group cohesion \cite{janik1998context}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/whistles.pdf}
    \caption{Sequence of dolphin whistles from the Carimam dataset. \ac{STFT} parameters are $fs=256kHz$, $NFFT=8192$, $hopsize=512$, $padding=0\%$, Mel transformed from 5 to 40\,kHz, and \ac{PCEN} normalised. The stationary signal around 12\,kHz is the remaining self noise of the sound card used \cite{barchasz2020novel} (despite heavy mitigation via the \ac{PCEN}).}
    \label{fig:whistle}
\end{figure}


\section{Data at hand}

In order to experiment on detection and classification mechanisms for the target species and signals aforementioned, datasets are needed. Through this thesis, work has been conducted on both recordings from local projects and publicly available ones. They involve a variety of recorders, locations and time spans which are described in this section, starting with the local projects of the DYNI team (Toulon University), and followed by the public Blue and Fin whale acoustic trends dataset.


\subsection{Data from DYNI}\label{chap:data_Toulon}

\end{figure}

Table~\ref{tab:recap_data} summarises some of the data yielded by the partnerships and projects that H. Glotin co-set up at Toulon University. They are stored locally in a \ac{NAS} system, funded by the DYNI team projects and maintained by the LIS laboratory. Each are briefly introduced in the following sections.

\subsubsection{Boussole}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
   \begin{minipage}{0.7\textwidth}

   \caption{(left) Installation of the Bombyx stereophonic antenna \cite{vamos2017}. (right) Structure of the Boussole antenna \cite{parsuivi}}\label{fig:antennas}
\end{figure}

This project consisted in a partnership between GIS3M, Pelagos marine mammal sanctuary, and Port-Cros National Park. In order to study marine mammals acoustic activity, a monophonic recording system was placed on the Boussole buoy. Originally dedicated to marine optics, this buoy designed to be transparent to swell was moored on the 2,440 meters deep sea floor, off the coast of Nice (France). During 4 phases between October 2008 and September 2009, the system recorded at 32\,kHz, enabling the detection of vocalisations from sperm whales, fin whales, and delphinids of the area (\textit{Stenella coeruleoalba, Globicephala melas, Grampus griseus, Tursiops truncatus and Delphinus delphis}).

A study prior to this thesis intended to monitor the acoustic presence of sperm whales and fin whales in the yielded recordings. Sperm whale clicks were successfully detected automatically but the processing of fin whale 20\,Hz pulses was hindered by the self noise of the system \cite{parsuivi} (Fig.~\ref{fig:boussole_noise}).

    \label{fig:boussole_noise}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Bombyx}

The Bombyx antenna was set up by a partnership between Toulon University, Port-Cros National Park, TVT Innovation, and the Pelagos marine mammal sanctuary. Being placed right on the rift of a 2000 meters deep canyon, it intends to allow the monitoring of sperm whales of the area \cite{vamos2017}. It did so during several phases spread across 4 years (2015 to 2018). The area is of interest because of the nearby canyons prone to sperm whale hunts \cite{fiori2014geostatistical}, but also because of the ferries that travel across on a daily basis. In addition to the noise that the latter generate, Bombyx recordings are also subject to self noise (Fig.~\ref{fig:bombyx_noise}).

    \label{fig:bombyx_noise}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{OrcaLab}

Paul Spong founded OrcaLab in the 1970s \cite{orcalab}, an in-situ observatory in the Johnstone Strait (British Columbia, Fig.~\ref{fig:ol_map}). It serves the visual and acoustic monitoring of orcas, especially the population that feeds on the local salmon every summer, the \ac{NRKW}. From 2015 to 2020, the 5 hydrophones' signals have been recorded continuously  (at 22,050\,Hz until march 2018, then at 44,100\,Hz).

The fact that the orcas regularly come to this relatively confined space represents an unique opportunity to observe and listen to them 24/7 from the shore. Most importantly, it guarantees no behavioral disturbance and continuous power and data storage supply, the main constraints of most \ac{PAM} approaches.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{fig/OL_map.png}
    \caption{Map of the OrcaLab observatory, with its 5 hydrophones and associated acoustic range.}
    \label{fig:ol_map}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{KM3Net}

The ORCA detector of the KM3Net observatory is an array of detection units allowing the measurement of neutrino particles \cite{aiello2021km3net}. It was installed on the seabed 2,440 meters deep, connected to the shore of Toulon (France) via fiber cable. Hydrophones are used as part of a positioning system, but as a by-product, also serve the \ac{PAM} of local cetaceans.


\subsubsection{Carimam}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{fig/effort_T1+T2.jpg}
    \caption{Map of recording stations with their recording effort for the Carimam project, in the Caribbean archipelago.}
    \label{fig:carimam_effort}
\end{figure}

The Carimam project, led by a consortium composed of AGOA, the OFB and Toulon University, is a network of 16 monophonic acoustic stations spread through the Caribbean archipelagos. It aims at monitoring the rich marine mammal activity of the area. To manage such a wide number of stations, low-cost and easy to install recording devices \cite{barchasz2020novel} were sent to local environmental managers, who set them up on existing mooring lines close to the shore.


\subsubsection{Spatialisation}

In Table \ref{tab:recap_data}, number of channels of each recording system are given. When synchronised and with overlapping acoustic coverage, multi-channel data can serve the spatialisation of acoustic sources. This is done via the computation of \acp{TDOA} for signals to be triangulated. For Bombyx, since two hydrophones record 1.8 meters apart (on the same horizontal plane, see Fig.~\ref{fig:antennas}), the two possible azymuths of acoustic sources can be computed. For Carimam, the stations' acoustic coverage do not overlap: the spatial precision is the acoustic range of the antennas. For KM3Net, the 3 hydrophones are approximately 30 meters apart. With prior knowledge on the depth of a source, its coordinates could be estimated (see section \ref{chap:km3net_triang}). Finally, for the OrcaLab network, hydrophones are several kilometers apart, but sent to a centralised \ac{DAC} via radio waves, which makes them temporally synchronised. Therefore, spatialisation could be performed in the zones of acoustic overlap.


\subsection{Blue and Fin whale acoustic trends dataset} \label{chap:acTrend}

In early 2021, a large acoustic dataset of antarctic mysticetes was made publicly available \cite{miller2021open}. It was built by a working group from the \ac{SOOS} titled Acoustic Trends of Antarctic blue and fin whales (Acoustic Trends Working Group; ATWG). The following is an extract from their terms of reference \cite{atwg_tor}:
\\
\textbf{\underline{SOOS Capability Working Group Key Objective(s):}}
\textit{
Continue to develop and mature a long term acoustic research program to understand trends in Southern Ocean blue and fin whale distribution, seasonal presence, and population growth through the use of passive acoustic monitoring techniques. Implementation of these objectives will occur via:
\begin{enumerate} \setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
    \item analysis and interpretation of existing ad-hoc acoustic datasets in from the Southern Ocean,
    \item the development and implementation of an ongoing network of long-term circumpolar underwater listening stations, and
    \item development of novel and efficient methods for standardised analysis of acoustic data collected in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic
\end{enumerate}}

It is regarding this third axis of work that the Acoustic Trends dataset was built and published, especially to share performance metrics for detection systems. It gathers annotations from a group of experts, on data yielded by several recorders at different locations from 2005 to 2017 (see Fig.~\ref{fig:soos_map} and Tab.~\ref{tab:soos_data}). Target signals are of 7 classes, 4 vocalisation types from blue whales (\textit{Balaenoptera Musculus}) and 3 vocalisation types from fin whales (\textit{Balaenoptera Physalus}).

Since this data has not been subject to custom annotations, I won't expand on the target signals which are described in the dataset publication \cite{miller2021open}.
